# MemCyan Game
1. Press Start game button
2. An icon appears briefly
3. Click on the icon within the time, icon shows in cyan
4. Another icon appears, ditto.
5. If that icon has already been shown, click on the first matching icon
6. If correct, both go to show in cyan
7. If not, both go red briefly, then back to the image icon to be shown again, ie you lose those icons.
8. Level Two - the icons don't show cyan when clicked upon, meaning you have to remember them!
